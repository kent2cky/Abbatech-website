      This Bootstrap sidebar is positioned on the left side of the webpage. It
      has vertical tabs with a hover effect. On mouse hover over the tabs,
      sections of texts appear on the webpage. So your website users do not have
      to click on the tabs to view the sections of texts. By just hovering the
      mouse over the texts, he/she can see the content under each of the tabs. A
      CodePen user with the username ‘Vosidiy M’ has developed this sidebar
      example using Bootstrap. If you need this kind of a sidebar for your
      website for showing texts under vertical tabs, you can download this
      template and can use it on your website. Its design is very standard. By
      tweaking it a bit, it will look better and more appropriate on your site.
